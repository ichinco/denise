    From 2007-2009, I worked in the lab
    of <a href="http://tedlab.mit.edu/">Ted Gibson</a> on a variety of
    projects. With <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-kraemer/11/418/238">John
    Kraemer</a>, I analyzed the permissible orderings of
    sentences/ideas in a text
    (<a href="http://coli.lili.uni-bielefeld.de/Texttechnologie/Forschergruppe/PTTR/abstracts/Abstract-Kraemer.pdf">discourse
    analysis</a>). My project
    with <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/">Michael
    Frank</a> looked at cross-situational learning. I
    presented <a href="http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers/frank-cogsci08-generalization.pdf">the
    paper</a> at the Conference of the Cognitive Science Society in
    2009.

    Before 2008, I was a linguist. I wrote a phonology paper on the
    distinction between the vowel sounds in the words "Merry",
    "Marry", and "Mary" which I presented at the Cornell Undergrad
    Linguistics Colloqium.

  <h1>Neuroscience</h1>

    In 2008, I worked with Liora Las in the lab
    of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/feelab/">Michale Fee</a>. We were
    studying activity in the ventral tegmental area of the songbird.

    In 2006, I worked in the lab
    of <a href="http://med.fsu.edu/index.cfm?fuseaction=directory.full&usemenu=&usetemplate=column&directoryID=15638">Nancy
      Hayes</a> at UMDNJ as a SURP student. My project looked at
    neurogenesis in mice as a response to the morris water maze.
