You have *got* to build a secure foundation. You have to start with the smallest bit of code, be certain that it works as it is intended, and then build on top of that. Otherwise-- how are you ever to determine in what part of the code the error lies? This sort of wisdom applies to hardware and the tools that support development as well as to the software itself.
