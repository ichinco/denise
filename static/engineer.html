    In addition to my <a href="scientist.html">analytics</a> role, I
    also build the software that aggregates the data into reports and
    communicates with the partners (ie, Google or MSN) to make bidding
    strategy changes. My focuses have been: increasing access to data
    via self-service reporting, increasing the useability of the
    tools, and improving the peformance of the automated jobs.

    My main accomplishment was to develop a 3D client for their
    flagship online football game on an aggressive schedule. The
    client was developed in Unity3D and I gave a talk at Unite 2010 on
    some of the problems (and solutions) we encountered integrating
    the problem with the web. I also devoted significant time to
    troubleshooting game networking issues and creating reliable and
    automatic build pipelines for game assets.
