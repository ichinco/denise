					<p>
I don't think we pause to think about whether we need dynamic pages enough
before we decide to build them. Dynamic content, for the purposes of this 
discussion, requires a server actively running code, which generates each
page on the fly. Static pages require a server which accesses memory to 
deliver the same result every time.
</p>

<p>
Generating dynamic pages is slower and often introduces two additional points
of failure in your application: the server and the database. Compared to 
static hosting, it is more expensive. Unlike known static content, dynamic 
content cannot take advantage of efficient edge caching that makes the web
fast.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> provides a static solution
for blogs. While it does require technical skills to use, it allows you to
take advantage of the natural cadence of blogging: the site only changes
when I change it, so why should we pretend that it might have changed every 
time a user asks to see it? (We can handle comments using an external 
provider like disqus). The great thing about it is that you can use all
of the tools you've grown accustomed to for building dynamic sites, including 
templating engines and sass. Then a simple compile step produces your static
site which is ready for upload to any hosting service. 
</p>

<p>
The only downside, as I alluded to before, is that it is relatively hard to
use for a non-techincial blogger. You would need to be familiar with ruby and
ruby gems and comfortable working on the commandline to resolve issues. 
You'll need to put everything in its specific folder in a specific file format,
so I hope you were paying attention. And, while there are dozens of jekyll 
themes, any customization would require digging into the root html.
</p>

<p>
That being said, it should be fairly straightforward for anyone who has
built a rudimentary website before. It's relatively obvious how to use 
layouts to make your code more modular, and how to create header and footer
files to further break out chunks of html. 
</p>

<p>
I think jekyll is an impressive bit of technology in itself, but also for
the philosophy it brings to developing a website. It encourages us to think
before we start coding. Do we need a database? How simple can we make this
page? Because if we can make it really simple, we can make a faster, more
available page for much, much cheaper.
