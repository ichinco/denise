				<section>
					<p>
Like search engine optimization, social media is a low cost (though much more time intensive) way to gain new customers. In addition, it can help you communicate with people who've been to your business in the past, converting them into returning users.
</p>

<h3>Why are social networks powerful?</h3>

<p>
Many people (especially in certain demographics) visit social networks as a part of their everyday online routine. When someone "likes" or "follows" your busines's page, the messages that you write will be visible to them in the same stream as updates from their friends-- a very powerful place in their mindshare!
</p>

<p>
In addition, social networks are built around the concept of "sharing," or sending content to your friends. If you post something that someone thinks is worth broadcasting, it is seamless for them to share your content with some (or hopefully all) of their friends. This broadens the reach of your message.
</p>
<h3>How does Social Marketing work?</h3>

<p>
The cast of characters in the social game is always changing, so it makes sense to pay attention to the news and see which networks are popular, who they are popular with, and which make sense for your advertising style. You may need to mix and match for the optimum balance.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Facebook. Allows you to post picture/text "updates." Users who "like" your page will see your updates in their feed. They can also post to your wall and share your posts.</li>
<li>Twitter. Allows you to post text "tweets" (with links to images). Users who "follow" your page will see your updates in their stream. They can tweet at you to respond or retweet to share.</li>
<li>Pinterest. Allows you to post images in a pinboard style. Very popular for recipes and wedding planning."
<li>Youtube. Allows you to post videos.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you create accounts on one or more of these sites, you will have to begin posting content and trying to attract users. As you post, try to think of what kind of content will be interesting to your customers-- and, especially, interesting to their friends. If you work in the hospitality industry, pictures may be powerful; not only of your establishment but also the surroundings. Does your business have specials of the day? New products on the shelves? Everyone will definitely want to know about specials and deals! Regular customers might find information about changing hours useful as well.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to attracting your first followers, you'll have to get the word out somehow. Perhaps you can offer a bit of a bribe: an entry in a contest, a free cup of coffee, an extra night free? This can be particularly powerful if you can entice website visitors (who you may have spent money to acquire) to follow your feeds. That'll let you keep in contact with them and you'll be on the top of their mind when they're ready to buy!
</p>

<h3>How do you measure social marketing?</h3>

<p>
As you get into the swing of things, you'll want to keep track of the number of followers you have on each network and the number (and kind) of posts that get shared. If you link back to pages on your site, make sure you add the appropriate Google Analytics tracking so that you can measure how many people click through and whether they are interested in your services.
</p>

<h3>What are the downsides of social marketing?</h3>

<p>
Maintaining a social marketing feed can be a time consuming enterprise, and it can be tough to continuously generate new, interesting content that your customers will want to share. Some businesses may not lend themselves to sharing constant updates: it's unlikely a roofer will get many followers unless they do something extraordinary.
</p>
You should also consider how you will handle feedback from customers that you may get. Failing to respond promptly and politely to negative comments can have an extremely detrimental effect on your reputation, and it can be as widereaching (or more) than the reputation you were trying to build in the first place!
